# NgEcomKit

This project is a shared open source library of components and functions thelab uses for Angular ecom development.

## Filterable Grid

A collection of ngrx selector functions and interfaces to display a grid. We don't have any common UI for this at this time. The demo does include a very basic implementation just to show how filtering works.

## NG Yotpo

Angular wrapper around Yotpo's JS Widget

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
